# nof
A toy programming language

### Features
- Kinda looks like C
- Actually looks a lot like C
- Designed to be a minimal C like Go
- Made for myself lol

### Hello World
This is a basic Hello World program in Nof

```
include std;

void main() {
    print("Hello World");
}
```

### Status

Rewrote the lexer

Now implementing the parser

### Misc.
I initially wanted to make a small language that looked like C so I started making this, but then I forgot about it since the next day

I recently rediscovered this after scrolling through my old projects.
